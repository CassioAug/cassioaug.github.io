# My Personal Portfolio

This is the official repository for my personal portfolio website. It was created to serve as a central hub for my professional identity, showcasing my unique background as both a Lawyer and a Systems Developer. The goal is to present my skills, experience, and projects in a clean, modern, and accessible format.

## üí° About

This portfolio was designed not just as a resume, but as a demonstration of my ability to merge the worlds of law and technology. It reflects my professional philosophy: using technology to create innovative, efficient, and user-centric solutions. The project itself is a practical example of my front-end development skills.

## ‚ú® Key Features

**Dual-Language Content:** The entire site is available in both Portuguese (PT-BR) and English (EN-US). This is handled dynamically with a single JavaScript object containing all translations, allowing for seamless language switching without reloading the page.

**Adaptive Theme (Dark/Light Mode):** To enhance user comfort and accessibility, a theme switcher is implemented. It uses CSS variables for easy management of color palettes and localStorage to remember the user's preference across sessions.

**- Fully Responsive Design:** Built with a mobile-first approach using the Bootstrap 5 framework, the layout fluidly adapts to all screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

**- Interactive UI & Smooth Navigation:** The website functions as a single-page application with smooth-scrolling navigation. JavaScript is used to handle scroll events, update the active navigation link, and create a seamless user journey through the different sections.

## üé® Design & Development Philosophy

**Modern & Professional UI:** The design follows a clean and minimalist aesthetic to convey professionalism and keep the focus on the content. The color palette (--primary-color, --secondary-color, --accent-color) was chosen to be professional yet distinctive. The typography combines "Inter" for readability in body text with "Playfair Display" for elegant headings.

**Modular Code:** The HTML is structured semantically, and the CSS is organized with clear, reusable classes. JavaScript logic is separated into modules for different functionalities (theme switching, language, form handling), making the code easier to maintain and scale.

**Performance:** The site is built with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring fast load times and easy, low-cost deployment on platforms like GitHub Pages. All assets are optimized for the web.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

This project was built using the following modern web technologies:

- **HTML5:** For the semantic structure and content of the pages.
- **CSS3:** For custom styling, animations, and the implementation of light/dark themes using CSS variables.
- **JavaScript:** For all interactivity, including theme switching, language management, smooth scrolling, and form handling.
- **Bootstrap 5:** A powerful front-end framework used for its responsive grid system and UI components.
- **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons used throughout the site.
- **Google Fonts:** For the "Inter" and "Playfair Display" typography.
